definition of encoder vs. decoder in transformer, and can it just be the masking, and can you turn encoder to a decoder by just masking it

potential next steps
- how does eos-token  = padding token impact training
- why 81, not 77?


life improvements
- training resuming, incl. wandb to support it
- setup & run faster gpu training
